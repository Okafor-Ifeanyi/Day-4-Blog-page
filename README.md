Genesys 20 days Coding Challenge

Day 4 - Build an Order Summary

It says day 4 but am submitting this a bit late because of my really tight schedule and asuu just called of the strike.

My Inspiration here would be God and My Family. God cause I started the project while in a 3 days retreat program and My Family cause they are the beautiful people you can see on the page. They both kept me going to doing this, programming this blog to the letter in accordance to the design.

Love you all, let me know what you think //
